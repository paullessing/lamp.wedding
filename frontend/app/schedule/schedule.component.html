      <p>Arrive, snag the second-best seats (we've already reserved the best ones!), meet the other guests.</p>
      <p><i>Tip:</i> If you're introduced to an Austrian lady, she might go in for cheek kisses.<br>
        To avoid awkward head bumping, go for two: one left, one right. One is too few, three is too many. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrgLj9lOwk" target="_blank">Four is right out.</a></p>
      <p>There will only be light refreshments until dinner, so make sure you have lunch before arriving!</p>

    Sunday
  </h1>

  <p>
    Providing the weather is good, we're planning to have a picnic in Victoria Park in East London.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone is welcome, including kids and everyone who couldn't make it on Saturday!
  </p>

  <h3>When?</h3>
  <p>
    Come whenever you feel like, leave when you're bored.<br>
    We'll be aiming to arrive between 12 noon and 1pm and should be there most of the afternoon.<br>
    (Depending on how excited/tired/danced out we are it might be a little earlier or later!)
  </p>

  <h3>Where?</h3>

    with lovely shops:
  </p>
  <ul class="location-list">
    <li>Gail's: Bakery with really good bread and sandwiches</li>
    <li>Ginger Pig: Paul's favourite butcher's, sells great sausage rolls</li>
    <li>The Deli Downstairs: Not actually downstairs. But a lovely deli.</li>
  </ul>
